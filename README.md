## Gameplay

The objective of the game is to guide Pac-Man through a maze while eating all the dots (or pellets) without getting caught by the ghosts.

- Pac-Man starts in the middle of the maze.
- Move Pac-Man through the maze using the arrow keys to eat the dots.
- Avoid touching the ghosts; they will try to catch Pac-Man.

- The game ends when you either:
  - Eat all the dots and win.
  - Get caught by a ghost and lose.
